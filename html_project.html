               <h3>A Breif Overview of Myself</h3>
               <p>Hello reader! My name is <b>David Rose</b> and I am currently a student at Florida Gulf Coast University.
                  I have been carrying my aspirations since I was a little child. I was born in
                  Brick Township, New Jersey. I moved down to Naples, Florida when I was two, and have lived there ever since.
                  When growing up, I was fascinated by the architecture of Legos and I set myself a path to become an architect.
                  When I grew older, I came to adore computer games and applications and I decided to focus my interests in computers.
                  Some of my milestones include creating and executing the construction of a new garden for a <a href="https://www.graceplacenaples.org/" target="_blank" id="local">local</a> non-profit organization, demonstrating
                  leadership within the Boy Scouts of America, and getting accepted into an ABET accredited university in computer programming.
               </p>
               <p>
                  A few experiences I would like to share include participating in an exclusive hiking expedition and viewing 
                  inspiring Ted Talks about technology around the country. In my hiking expedition, I hiked along the Appalachian trail
                  for three days, and settled in a Boy Scout summer camp for a week. My expedition demonstrates the leadership and
                  resilience that I preform to overcome any situation. I have also expanded my thought process by observing several TED 
                  talks and viewing many more online.
               </p>
               <br />

               <h3>A Field Report on Computer Science</h3>
               <p>The studies of technology can be
                  broken down into several areas, including, but not limited to, computer science, software engineering, and information technology. Computer
                  science is the science of teaching machines how to store, execute, and display data. Software engineering is a specific branch of computer 
                  science; it is the design, development, and testing of application code. Information technology is not as constructive as Software engineering;
                  it is the organization and interpretation of information stored in machines. Other branches include Digital engineering, the design and development
                  of electronic components, and Integrated Circuit engineering, the development of computer chips. Computer science encompasses all of these
                  fields because each field involves understanding how to make inanimate objects preform logic using physics.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I am most interested in Software engineering, more specifically, Cyber-Security. As our society progresses into new generations of technology,
                  new threats will be formulated and cause massive difficulties in reliable internet. This will create a high demand for young engineering graduates
                  and comes with good starting salaries. Aside from the obvious, the reason I wish to fight Cybercrime is so I know that the online world becomes
                  a safer place for me and everyone else. Computer science will help me become the programmer I want to be by not only teaching me how to create
                  a code that hackers can get around using the backdoor, but by understanding the logic of computers and humans together, so I can have my 64-bit 
                  bloodhound wait for them behind the backdoor. In a bigger context, Computer science, along with other related courses, is only a catalyst in education;
                  an engineer truly reaches great outcomes by learning how to expand his or her thought process. On that note, I wouldn&#039;t recommend any scientist
                  or graduate to mimic the process of a robot or a CPU.

            <p>As one may see, I have a good-standing set of skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. My resume describes everything I am experienced and skilled at, but
               that won't define me as unique, as anyone can reasonable have the same amount of skills as I have. I argue that I am unique because of how I attained these
               experiences. I have also attained a good sence of the world of work, as my previous jobs and internships taught me that life is no easy stoll in the park 
               like high school was.

            <p>Disabilities that user may have that could prevent optimal use of a website include vision, low coordinal movment and lack of computer drives (i.e. mouse).
               This websie has been designed to meed the demands of those in need. The text font has been increased to a large print to allow those with troubled
               vision to see better. There is also no contrast with any elements or texts. Users may also lack speedy motor skills. To meet the demand for this, animations
               move slower than normal and these users may read at a pace they wish to have. The text should be easy and understandable to read. For those users that lack 
               certain tools and only have a keyboard, all the necessary links to other pages are binded with keyboard shortcuts. All navigation remains on the same page
               to provide an easy access back to the home page and to prevent tab overflow. For users running their browsers withoug javascript or up-to-date software, friendly
               alternatives have been added to the webpage.
